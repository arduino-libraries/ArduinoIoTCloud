/*
  This sketch demonstrates how to exchange data between your board and the Arduino IoT Cloud.

  Connect a potentiometer (or other analog sensor) to A1 and an LED to Digital Pin 5.
  When the potentiometer (or sensor) value changes the data is sent to the Cloud.
  When you flip the switch in the Cloud dashboard the onboard LED lights gets turned ON or OFF.

  IMPORTANT:
  This sketch will work with both WiFi and GSM enabled boards supported by Arduino IoT Cloud.
  By default, settings for WiFi are chosen. If you prefer to use a GSM board take a look at thingProperties.h arduino_secrets.h,
  to make sure you uncomment what's needed and comment incompatible instructions.
