   *
   * -- Don't use 3DES if AES or ChaCha20 is available.

   *    better than RSA key exchange (slightly more expensive on the
   *    client, but much cheaper on the server, and it implies smaller
   *    messages).
   * -- ChaCha20+Poly1305 is better than AES/GCM (faster, smaller code).
   * -- GCM is better than CBC.
   * -- AES-128 is preferred over AES-256 (AES-128 is already
   *    strong enough, and AES-256 is 40% more expensive).
